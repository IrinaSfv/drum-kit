### Simple game where you can try yourself as a drummer.

With native JavaScript I've added event listeners to the drum buttons. When clicking on a certain drum, its sound is played. The same logic is performed when pressing the buttons on the keyboard.

## Installation
* Run `GitBash` (or `Terminal` on MacOS);
* Select or create a new repository where you want to put the project;
* Run the command: `git clone https://github.com/IrinaSfv/drum-kit.git`;
* Open the project in any convenient code editor.

## Usage
